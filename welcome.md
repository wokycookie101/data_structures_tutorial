# Data Structures: An Overview

We create data structures to help organize our code. whether we use them to store, retrieve, or process data, learning to utilize data structures is possibly the most important thing to learn if you want to compile algorithms, or build much more sophisticated software. 

Here, I've gone into great detail on the different types of data structures that are imperitive to learning how to effectively organize data. You can read the tutorials of each type below:

* [Queues](queues.md)
* [Sets](sets.md)
* [Trees](trees.md)

Once you master these concepts, you'll be well on your way to becoming an extremely efficient and valuable programmer.
